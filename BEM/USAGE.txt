These are a collection of script to parse a BLAST output,
and try to rebuild the matches found into full (or at least large) elements.

It's supposed to follow the order:
1. blast
2. sort_by_element
3. clean_embedded
4. cut overlaps
5. chao_join
 # After this, we should have the longest elements but many elements
 # may cover the same genome spot. From here on, we repeat the previous steps
 # but without element restriction
6. sort_joined
7. clean_embedeed_2
8. cut_overlaps
